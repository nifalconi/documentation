# Slack Documentation Guide

## Overview

We’re using Slack to document and share solutions to technical issues. This approach helps us avoid repeating solved problems and makes it easy for everyone to access solutions.

## Scenarios

1. **Sharing an Obscure Solution**: Found something tricky? Post it.
2. **Summarizing a Group Solution**: Solved something as a team? Share the final outcome.
3. **You created a Slack Thread asking for help**: At the end of the conversation share the outcome of the solution. 

## Template

```markdown
- *Problem*: [One-liner of the issue] [Status **Solved** / **Not-Solved**]

- *Desciption*: [Short Problem Description]
- *Solution*: [Brief solution steps]
- *Resource*: [Link, if any]
- *Tags*: #[RelatedTopic]
- *Contributors*: @[Name], @[Name] 
```

## Why It Matters

**Save Time:** Quick access to past solutions.

**Knowledge Sharing:** Enhances our collective intelligence.

_Keep it concise, keep it clear, and let’s keep it moving forward._
